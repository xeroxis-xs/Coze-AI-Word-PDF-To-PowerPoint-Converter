# PDF/Word Document to PowerPoint Converter

The objective of this project is to leverage the Coze AI platform to develop a specialized chatbot assistant. This chatbot will assist users in reading and processing PDF or Word documents, subsequently generating a presentation outline based on the content.

Using the generated presentation outline in conjunction with DALLE3 from Coze AI, the chatbot can produce images suitable for slide backgrounds, enhancing the visual appeal of the presentation.

It also allow users to customise the formatting of the sldies such as font sizes and aspect ratios.

## Features and Tools

1. Plugin

We have designed a custom plugin using Python, leveraging the python-pptx library. This plugin provides a straightforward and customizable PowerPoint creation capability tailored to the user's needs.

2. Workflow

To ensure seamless execution of the chatbot's functionalities, we have established multiple workflows. These workflows serve as structured guides for the chatbot, orchestrating the processes of document reading, content processing, formatting, and ultimately, slide creation in PowerPoint.
